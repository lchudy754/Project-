Since the midterm, I started by fixing the bug that broke the game if the user input the wrong number. I then fixed the hardcoded numbers "5,4,9" that were pointed out in the midterm comments by adding the variable "BOARD_SIZE". I also redid the tests for this updated code which should hopefully work better now. 

5x5 Tic Tac  Toe Game. This is a two-player tic-tac-toe game on an expanded 5x5 board. This is expanded from the original project code that had a 3x3 board. 
The players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board by selecting row 0-4 and column 0-4, and the game checks for wins or draws after each move. 
Players win when getting 5 in a row of their mark in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
The code will not let a player put their mark where there is one already, and it will check for wins or a draw (full board) after each move that a player makes. 
Player X goes first, and then player O follows.

In the github, there is the basic code, a test suite, the answers to the questions from the project guidelines, and this readme.
